## Phase reports

When completing a build phase (per the phased build order in the active build
spec), write a phase report instead of printing it to the terminal.

- Path: `docs/reports/NN-phase-name.md` (e.g. `01-foundations.md`), where `NN`
  is the zero-padded phase number and `phase-name` is a short kebab-case
  description.
- Format: plain markdown only. No terminal color codes, no box-drawing
  characters.
- Contents, in this order:
  1. What was built, by file
  2. Deviations from the spec and why
  3. Bugs found and fixed, including anything that only surfaced at
     bundle/runtime rather than at typecheck
  4. Verification: exact commands run and their results
  5. Open questions or decisions that had to be guessed
  6. What's next
- When done, print only the file path in the terminal response — not the
  report body.
